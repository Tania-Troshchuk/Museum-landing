# Museum landing page

Museum landing page - [DEMO LINK](https://tania-troshchuk.github.io/Museum-landing/).

This landing page was implemented to announce events taking place in the National Art Museum of Ukraine. This landing page contains brief information about the exhibitions taking place, their authors, dates, and images of certain paintings that will be presented.

Museum landing page - this is one of my works, which I performed using knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM, and JavaScript. The landing page was developed by implementing an adaptive layout (using a Grid and Flexbox).

This landing was developed according to the layout [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/cRBCqE06cDrY3s4jX7h3iY/%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9C%D0%A3-(Edit)?node-id=0%3A1).

This landing page was designed according to the layout for such devices as:
- phone (with a screen width of more than 320 pixels);
- tablet (with screen width from 768 pixels to 1280 pixels);
- notebook (with a screen width of more than 1280 pixels).
